    participant U as User
    participant F as Frontend
    participant A as Auth API
    participant D as Database
    
    U->>F: Login Request
    F->>A: POST /auth/login
    A->>D: Validate Credentials
    D-->>A: User Data
    A-->>F: JWT Token
    F-->>U: Login Success
```

### Job Application Flow

    participant F as Frontend
    participant A as Jobs API
    participant D as Database
    
    U->>F: Submit Application
    F->>A: POST /jobs/applications
    A->>D: Store Application
    D-->>A: Application Data
    A-->>F: Success Response
    F-->>U: Application Confirmation
```
